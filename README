# EV Automation
This project aims to add some simple automation and control around
my GivEnergy home solar/battery system, Andersen A2 EV charger and
Renault electric vehicle.

## Goals
- Charge the house battery or the car from solar, but not at the same time
- Do not discharge the house battery when charging the car
- Charge the car from grid when offpeak, otherwise from solar
- Provide an API which can be invoked from an Alexa skill to give voice control

## Current State
This is currently experimental. Access to the three main components
is implemented and a simple model and controller are in development.
